## f79b: *Perfect palindromic cubes*

A number *x* is a *perfect palindromic cube* if it is a perfect cube (i.e., *x*=*y*<sup>3</sup> for some integer *y*), and it is a palindrome when
written in decimal (i.e., it appears the same backwards).  For example, 1030301 is a perfect palindromic cube: it is clearly a palindrome, and 101<sup>3</sup> = 1030301.

Write a program that enumerates the first 1500 non-negative integers, and indicates which integers yield palindromic numbers when they are cubed.  The output of your program should begin:

```
0 cubed is 0
1 cubed is 1
2 cubed is 8
7 cubed is 343
```

Think about whether or not your program would work properly if you continued significantly larger non-negative integers.  If it would not, why not?

**Hints:**  You may find the `length` and `charAt` methods of the `String` class useful.
These are *instance methods*: you invoke them on a `String` object.  Also,
you may find the `String.valueOf` method helpful to turn an `int` into a `String`.  This is
a *class method* (also called a *global method* or *static method*): you invoke it independently of a `String`
object.  See the Java documentation for more details.
