## c2b8: *Irresponsible rectangle*

Inspect the Java classes listed below, and identify any design flaws you can
see.
Rewrite the classes in a way that does not change their behaviour,
such that these design flaws are fixed.  The process of improving the
design of software without changing its behaviour is called *refactoring*.

In the following code it is assumed that rectangles are oriented such that the
coordinate (0,0) is at the top-left of some drawing area, the *x*-axis extends to the right,
and the *y*-axis extends downward.  This is common in computer software, even though it is
contrary to the usual mathematical setting where the *y*-axis extends upwards.

Note that `DrawingEngine.java` is indicative of a class that could
represent the state of a drawing program.  Obviously this class is incomplete:
currently it simply stores a set of rectangles.  This incompleteness is *not*
one of the design flaws this question aims to illustrate!
