## 98e3: *... 1 4 2 1 4 2 1 ...*

Write a Java method `int next(int x)` that takes a positive integer argument `x` and returns:

* `x / 2` if `x` is even
* `3 * x + 1` if `x` is odd

Write a program that takes a positive integer command-line argument as an initial value and displays this value, then stores the value in a variable and
repeatedly applies `next` to the variable, displaying each value that is computed.  The program should terminate when the value `1` is computed.
For instance, given the input `37`, your program should print:

```
37 112 56 28 14 7 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
```

It is unknown whether this program is guaranteed to terminate for any integer input: the *Collatz conjecture* posits that it does.

Remember that the `main` method of your program has an argument `args` that is an array of type `String`.
Thus the first command-line argument can be accessed via `args[0]`.  To turn this argument into an integer, you can use the
`parseInt` method of the `Integer` class.  E.g.:

```
int integerVersionOfFirstArgument = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
```
