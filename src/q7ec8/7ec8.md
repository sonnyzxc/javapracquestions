## 7ec8: *Battling fighters*

In this question you will simulate a battle between fighters
using rules based on the [Fighting Fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_Fantasy) adventure game books.

A **fighter** has a *name* (e.g. "Joe"), a *type* (e.g. "Elf Lord"), and
two further attributes: *skill*, an integer initialised to a value between 1 and 18 that remains fixed, and *stamina*, an integer
initialised to a value between 1 and 24.

A battle between two fighters consists of a series of rounds.  In a round, each fighter computes an *attack score*.  This
is obtained by rolling two dice, and adding the result to the fighter's skill.  If both fighters compute the same attack
score, the round results in a draw.  Otherwise the fighter with the higher attack score hits the fighter with the lower
attack score, whose stamina is reduced by two (or set to zero if it is currently set to one).  The battle ends when
one of the fighters' stamina becomes zero.

Your task is to design two classes: `Fighter` and `GameEngine`.

The
`Fighter` class should contain fields to represent the attributes of a fighter, an appropriate constructor, as well as (at least)
the following
methods:

```
// Reduce the fighter's stamina accordingly
public void takeDamage(int damage);

// Return the number of damage points to be inflicted on opponent
public int calculateDamage();

// Calculate an attack score for the fighter using the procedure described above
public int calculateAttackScore();

// Determine whether fighter is still alive
public boolean isDead();
```

With the exception of `calculateAttackScore`, these methods should be
trivial to implement.

The `GameEngine` should contain (at least) the following method:

```
// Simulate battle between two fighters, displaying how the battle
// progresses and who wins
public void simulateBattle(Fighter first, Fighter second) {
```

Finally, you should provide a `Main` class with a `main` method
that creates two fighters and a game engine, and launches the simulated battle.

The output of your program should look something like this:

```
At start of battle, stats are:
Joe - Human Warrior - skill: 16; stamina: 12
Alex - Elf Lord - skill: 18; stamina: 6
------------------------------
Alex hits Joe, stats are:
Joe - Human Warrior - skill: 16; stamina: 10
Alex - Elf Lord - skill: 18; stamina: 6
------------------------------
Joe hits Alex, stats are:
Joe - Human Warrior - skill: 16; stamina: 10
Alex - Elf Lord - skill: 18; stamina: 4
------------------------------
Alex hits Joe, stats are:
Joe - Human Warrior - skill: 16; stamina: 8
Alex - Elf Lord - skill: 18; stamina: 4
------------------------------
Alex hits Joe, stats are:
Joe - Human Warrior - skill: 16; stamina: 6
Alex - Elf Lord - skill: 18; stamina: 4
------------------------------
Joe draws with Alex
------------------------------
Alex hits Joe, stats are:
Joe - Human Warrior - skill: 16; stamina: 4
Alex - Elf Lord - skill: 18; stamina: 4
------------------------------
Alex hits Joe, stats are:
Joe - Human Warrior - skill: 16; stamina: 2
Alex - Elf Lord - skill: 18; stamina: 4
------------------------------
Alex hits Joe, stats are:
Joe - Human Warrior - skill: 16; stamina: 0
Alex - Elf Lord - skill: 18; stamina: 4
------------------------------
End of battle, Alex - Elf Lord - skill: 18; stamina: 4 wins!
