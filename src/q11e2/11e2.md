## 11e2: *Bounded generic methods with streams*

In a class, `Example`, write a static method, `getSmallestCollection`.  For any element type `E` this method should accept a `List`, `collections`, of any type `C` such that `C` is a subtype of `Collection<E>` (including `Collection<E>` itself).

The return type of the method should be `Optional<C>`.  The method should return `Optional.empty()` if `collections` is an empty list.  Otherwise, the method should return an optional containing one of the *smallest* elements of the list, as judged by the `size()` method that is available on any subtype of `Collection<E>`.

For example, if we have this list of sets available:

    final Set<Integer> s1 = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4));
    final Set<Integer> s2 = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2));
    final Set<Integer> s3 = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4));
    final Set<Integer> s4 = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(3, 4));
    final List<Set<Integer>> listOfSetsOfIntegers = Arrays.asList(s1, s2, s3, s4);

then doing:

    final Optional<Set<Integer>> smallestSet = getSmallestCollection(listOfSetsOfIntegers);

should yield an optional that contains either `s2` or `s4`, as these are the joint-smallest sets in the list of sets.

Your implementation of `getSmallestCollection` should be a one-liner that streams the list and performs an identity-free reduction.

Implement a main method that demonstrates your method in action on a list of sets of integers, and a list of lists of strings.


**Hints:**  The real challenge here is to work out the right signature for the method `getSmallestCollection`.

* You might try to first implement:

        static Optional<Collection<Integer>> getSmallestCollection(List<Collection<Integer>>) { ... }

  to get your solution working for the explicit case of a list of collections of integers.

* Then you could work out how to make the method work on lists of collections of some arbitrary type `E`.

* Finally, you could work out how to make the method work on a list of any subtype of `Collection<E>` (that's the hardest bit).
